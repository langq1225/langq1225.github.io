Hey, this is Langqing.

Welcome to my private blog — a quiet corner on the internet where I'll jot down thoughts about research, life, and whatever else crosses my mind.

## Why Here?

Mainly for myself. Sometimes you need a place to think out loud without the noise of social media. This is that place.

## What to Expect?

Probably a mix of:

- **Research notes** — Efficient AI, model compression, things I'm learning at KAIST
- **Technical deep-dives** — Code, experiments, failures, and lessons
- **Random thoughts** — Books, ideas, life as a PhD student

No promises on frequency. I'll write when there's something worth saying.

If you're reading this, well... you found the secret spot. 👀
